    <h4>
        The hospital serves as a regional referral and teaching hospital providing the highest level of care for women
        and infants, and trauma and cardiac patients. Inside our remodeled state of the art facility, our renowned
        medical professionals use the latest technologies to provide unparalleled care with compassion.
        Our Imaging Center features advanced imaging technology, including the latest digital mammography, MRI, digital
        radiology, ultrasound, and dual energy Xray equipment. The Cristie Kerr Women’s Health Center and the Women’s
        Health Center at 116 Newark Avenue (at Grove Street) offer women convenient access to the highest level of
        medical care. Together, they represent a leap forward in Hudson County health services.
        Jersey City Medical Center is the provider of Advanced Life Support for Hudson County. JCMC is a Regional Trauma
        Center, a Level III Regional Neonatal Intensive Care Center, and a Regional Heart Hospital with cardiac
        surgery.<br><br>
        Our hospital is the only three-time Magnet‐Designated Hospital for Nursing Excellence in Hudson, Union, or Essex
        counties.
        In 2015, Jersey City Medical Center invested in the health care needs of Jersey City with the renovation of the
        Greenville Hospital facility on Kennedy Boulevard as an outpatient medical center. Now, along with RWJBarnabas
        Health, Jersey City Medical Center remains steadfast in its commitment to provide for the needs of Greenville
        and all of Hudson County with a unique array of services intended to enhance care for families who need it most.
        Jersey City Medical Center provides 24/7 emergency services at RWJBarnabas Health at Bayonne. This
        fully‐licensed emergency department has all the same capabilities as a traditional emergency room, staffed with
        board‐certified emergency room physicians, specially‐trained nurses, technicians and health care
        professionals.<br><br>
        Doctors/staff can give more time to patients rather than focusing on management which will increase the
        efficiency thus eventually increasing the brand value of the hospital.
        In times of calamity(eg covid) the problem of beds will not be faced and thus patients will receive easy and
        better treatment.
